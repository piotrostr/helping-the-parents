This project's aim is to create an easy-to-use eye-tracking software based on the paper:

```
@inproceedings{Park2020ECCV,
  author    = {Seonwook Park and Emre Aksan and Xucong Zhang and Otmar Hilliges},
  title     = {Towards End-to-end Video-based Eye-Tracking},
  year      = {2020},
  booktitle = {European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)}
}
```

The main goals of the project are to deliver an efficient pipeline for camera calibration (both intrinsic and extrinsic) as well as real-time eye patch extraction.
